# Gameplay:

You have to kill enemy ships for five rounds straight. You can kill an enemy ship with only one bullet. If you crash into the enemy, the enemy ship will die, and you will lose 10hp. If an enemy ship manages to pass you, and go off screen, you will lose a life. If you lose all 5 lives, you lose the game. Your health bar is 100 when maxed out, if it goes down to 0, you lose the game. Your health bar decreases 10hp everytime an enemy's bullet hits you.
After five rounds you will have to face the final boss, which has a health bar of 200. Everytime you hit the final boss, 5 hp will be removed from their health bar. Crashing into the final boss will lose you 50 hp, and will remove 10 hp from the boss's health. If you manage to kill the final boss, you have beaten the game. 


## Project Description

This is short fun game, that resembles some of the older Space arcade games. This project was built using the ```pygame``` library. The program uses object oriented programming, where each class and function have a specific task which they do.
